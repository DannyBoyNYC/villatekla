<h2 id="directions">Directions from Quepos and San Jose</h2>

<p>
  Note: there are no addresses in this part of Costa Rica. To get anywhere you
  need to provided directions using local landmarks. E.g. “turn left at Villa
  Lirio and go 200 meters until 12 meters before Super Joseth.”
</p>

<h3>From Quepos to Villa Tekla</h3>
<p>
  The trip to Villa Tekla starts on the main road to Manuel Antonio National
  Park with one turn at Hotel Villas Lirio.
</p>
<p>
  Once you leave Quepos towards the beaches be on the alert for Villas Lirio on
  your left (about a five minute ride). Villas Lirio is preceded by Hotel Teva
  and then Captains Hotel on the left. In front of Villas Lirio you will find
  the road to Villa Tekla. Continue approx 250 meters up the road until Finca
  los Mangos - 10 meters before the small Super Joseth market and a fork in the
  road. (Do not go past the store!) Villa Tekla is on the left before the fork
  with a black metal gate with a VILLA TEKLA sign. The driveway leads to a white
  three-level house.
</p>
<p>
  The buses from San Jose will let you off across from the Manuel Antonio
  school. The local buses will let you off at the stops near the school's soccer
  field. The house is a 5 minute walk from the school up the Villa Lirio road.

<h3 id="sjo">San Jose to Quepos</h3>
<p>
  Traveling in Costa Rica can be an exciting and educational part of your
  vacation experience, but it also has the potential to be challenging. Due to
  the topography of the country, the infrastructure and the weather, travel
  times can vary widely. You should fly into our international airport in San
  José (Juan Santamaria). From there you'll have several options to get to the
  Quepos/Manuel Antonio area. Your choice will be based upon the arrival and
  departure times of your flights in/out of San José, personal preferences, and
  your budget.

      between the domestic terminal adjacent to the San Jose international
      airport and Quepos. Up to 7 flights a day. Cost: under $100 USD. Time: 20
      minutes. Planning note: none of the local airports in Costa Rica have
      runway lights or control towers, so the flights only operate from sunrise
      to sunset (about 6:30 AM until 5 PM) and less frequently from May thru
      November.

    <p>
      Check baggage policies carefully. The weight limits are enforced, which
      means that while they will take your bags, you’ll pay for the extra
      weight. Upon arrival in San José, you’ll need at least 1½ hours before
      your flight to Quepos. When returning to San José to connect with your
      international flight give yourself 2 hours to connect.
    </p>

    <p>
      Take an express bus between the San Jose and Manuel Antonio bus terminals.
      Approximately 3 hours. Cost: ~$30 USD. For reasons that mystify us, no
      buses pick up at the international airport thus necessitating an arduous
      trip into the city.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Take a taxi directly from the San Jose airport. Cost: $120-160 USD
      depending on season, vehicle and your bargaining accumen. Approx. 2.5
      hours. It is a pleasant drive unless you're travelling to the coast at the
      end of the week when traffic can get a bit heavy.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Rent a car at the airport. You do not need a car in Manuel Antonio as bus
      and taxi service are more than adequate. If desired, you can rent a car in
      Manuel Antonio for day trips.

    <p>
      Notes: after a long, international flight, it can be very stressful and
      time consuming, picking up a rental car and finding your way to Manuel
      Antonio, especially at night. Renting will take at least an hour. (No
      express service here.) Upon returning the car, it will take 45 minutes for
      them to inspect it, close the contract and to get back to the airport.
      According to some, Adobe is the best of a bad lot and will not attempt to
      upsell insurance etc.
