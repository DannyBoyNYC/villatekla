      <h2 id="about">Privacy, security, nature</h2>

      <p>
        Villa Tekla is a distinctive three-bedroom, three-level Spanish-Moorish
        hacienda, an eco-friendly villa designed for the tropics, on five acres
        of forest and landscaped grounds, with ocean and mountain views, set off
        the main road. It has extensive patios, is fully furnished and
        immediately adjacent is a private pool. It can easily accommodate three
        couples and is perfect for families traveling together.
      </p>
      <p>
        Villa Tekla is completely private - although you might hear an
        occasional vehicle on the road, there are no visible neighbors. It feels
        as though you are in the middle of the jungle - with the convenience of
        a store at the end of the long driveway!
      </p>
      <p>
        Especially designed for the climate of Costa Rica's south-central coast,
        Villa Tekla is an open house, with screened lower, main and upper level
        bedrooms. It is protected from both sun and rain by wide roof overhangs
        and is intended to provide an optimal experience for nature lovers and
        yet be entirely secure. Sitting atop a volcanic spur over jungle that
        runs all the way to Manuel Antonio National Park, it is open to the
        west, north and east - towards the ocean and the forests and the
        mountains. Rare precious and semi-precious flowering hardwoods shade it
        from the sun.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some of the acreage is planted in various fruit species, the rest of it
        is a natural canopied forest. The pool has tiled patios immediately
        adjacent to the house.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        Villa Tekla is our family home. We do not rent it as a profit-making
        business, but only to ensure that we will not have to lay off any of our
        loyal, longterm staff for the months we aren’t there.
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        The property is midway between the thriving tourist town of Quepos and
        the beaches of
        <a
          href="http://www.sinac.go.cr/EN-US/ac/acopac/pnma/Pages/default.aspx"
          target="_blank"
          >Manuel Antonio National Park</a
        >. The main beach is five minutes away by car or bus, thirty minutes by
        foot. Several smaller, less populated beaches are even closer and we can
        provide directions to them. The park, with its crescent beaches, trails
        and wildlife, offers nature lovers a unique, unforgettable experience.
        It opens at seven a.m. daily, but is closed Monday. It's best to visit
        early in the morning, when the wildlife is most active. Even though
        staying at Villa Tekla offers the opportunity to see as much, if not
        more, wildlife than a typical day in the park, it is still worth
        visiting for its wonderful walks and beaches.

        of Manuel Antonio National park.
      </p>
      <p>
        Though at nine degrees latitude, the climate is benign, the temperature
        ranging from the lows 20s to low 30s C (low 70s to low 80s F), depending
        on time and season. The dry season extends roughly from Christmas to
        Easter, but is variable, and is cooled by fresh breezes from the ocean
        during the hottest hours. The green season (there is no winter or summer
        in Costa Rica) is preferred by many, with its rain at night,
        late-afternoon sun-showers, morning mists, rainbows and verdant growth -
        and unpeopled beaches. Occasionally, the rain can fall in torrents, and
        it's an experience which many visitors enjoy. Wide roof overhangs and
        rain blinds keep the villa dry. The house has been carefully situated so
        that the sun does not enter in the heat of the day, and it offers
        brilliant sunset views in the Green Season.
      </p>
      <p>
        As you relax in our hammock, don't be surprised if the titis (squirrel
        monkeys) come by the house, swinging from tree to tree and clambering
        over the roof. Cara blancas (white-face cappuchin monkeys) visit
        regularly too, and in the early morning howler monkeys can be heard
        calling from the tall trees. Other animals we have seen from the house
        include sloths, coatis, raccoons, armadillos, anteaters, pacas, agoutis,
        land and tree iguanas, a peccary that wandered down from the mountains,
        and a Mexican dwarf porcupine. Birders will be awed by the numbers and
        variety of parrots, parakeets, hummingbirds, mot-mots, toucans,
        manikins, orioles, flycatchers, swallows, tanagers, woodpeckers, wrens,
        thrushes, trogons, hawks, and you'll awake at dawn to a many-throated
        chorus. At night you'll hear nightjars, owls, pootoos, laughing falcons,
        a constant melody of crickets and frogs, and the singing geckoes that
        patrol for small bugs. Birds and butterflies fly in and out.
      </p>

      <p>
        And from time to time you'll hear the distant crash and rumble of the
        Pacific surf.

        <h3>House Manager</h3>
        <p>
          Rebecca Wells is our villa manager in Manuel Antonio, and her husband
          Jacob is a skilled contractor and a computer electronics consultant.
          They live only a few minutes down our road. She and Jacob are
          completely bilingual, will help you with any problems, and will assist
          you with arrival arrangements.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="hint">
        <h3>Maid and Gardener</h3>
        <p>
          Our maid comes mornings twice a week for four or five hours. If you
          would like additional help, Rebecca can arrange for that at the maid's
          regularly hourly rate, and she can be hired as well to do your
          personal laundry in the washer/drier. There is also a wash and fold
          laundromat service nearby at Hotel Flor Blanca. Our gardener Walter
          comes once a week, early in the morning, for grounds maintenance. We
          hope you will treat our staff with trust and respect - they have ours.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="hint">
        <h3>Linens and Towels</h3>
        <p>
          We supply all essential household goods, including linens and towels,
          but please do not take our towels to the beach.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="hint">
        <h3>Communications</h3>
        <p>
          We have a smart TV with Netflix etc. available for use. Our house
          telephone line, 2777-1092, does not permit international calls.
          High-speed Internet service will provide those who bring devices with
          reliable WiFi. Since we often work from here internet access (fiber
          optic) is faster than you'll typically find elsewhere and can be
          upgraded up to 500mbps (for an additional charge) if required. The
          WiFi password is in the booklet near the phone.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cell towers are nearby and coverage is excellent for those who choose
          roaming.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="hint">
        <h3>Waste Disposal</h3>
        <p>
          Please follow basic ecologically sound practices. There's a white
          composting container in the kitchen which the gardener will sort and
          empty from time to time. If you wish to empty it yourself the compost
          bin is behind the garden shed near the entrance. The maid will dispose
          of garbage, but if you need to do so yourself, you may place bagged
          garbage into a neighbourhood bin just down the road which is emptied
          regularly by the municipal service.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="hint imagined">
        <div>
          <h3>Garden</h3>
          <p>
            Enjoy any fruit that ripens in the orchard. Bananas, papayas,
            pineapples, grapefruit, lemons, limes, sour and sweet oranges,
            mangos, coconuts, avocados and guayabana grow in front of and below
            the house. Many of these are seasonal, however, and our gardener
            will offer fruit as it comes available. It can be difficult for
            northerners to dsicent ripeness and availablity so please don't
            hesitate to ask him to pick for you. He's usually here on Fridays.

      </div>

      <div class="hint">
        <h3>Water</h3>
        <p>
          We are connected to the municipal system, and the water, as in most of
          Costa Rica is potable. Please rinse off beach sand in the outside
          shower before using those inside; otherwise the bathroom drains clog.
          We are on a septic system, so please do not flush non-biodegradables
          (dental floss, tampons, condoms etc.) which clog the septic tank.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="hint">
        <h3>Weather</h3>
        <p>
          The climate tends to make electronic equipment and kitchen appliances
          more fragile than up north, so take more care with them than you
          usually would. During the green season, keep anything sensitive and
          electronic such as computer equipment in the dehumidified built-in
          wall unit in the living room with the TV. The sliding doors should be
          kept shut and locked when the devices are not in use.
        </p>
        <p>
          A temporal - two or three successive days of rain and drizzle - occurs
          rarely, and only in the green season. Leather goods can get a coating
          of fungus and are not recommended for this climate. Keep clothing
          free-hung so it has proper air circulation. In this part of the world,
          people never leave wet clothing in a heap - that encourages mildew. If
          it pours, just remember that the sun will soon shine. It is only with
          strong winds that you need lower any of the rain blinds or shut the
          wooden blinds.
        </p>
        <p>
          The closest weather station isn’t updated automatically, it relies on the weather observations being phoned in, which may or may not happen with fixed regularity. Additionally, the micro-climates within Costa Rica make prediction of weather much more challenging than in other places. It almost always shows “raining”. It could be raining in one place while the sun is shining just ½ a mile away or the rain may last 30 minutes with sunshine the rest of the day.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="hint">
        <h3>Power</h3>
        <p>
          We are on the same voltage system as North America, and will run your
          hair dryer and all powered devices. The refrigerator should not be
          kept open, as that risks motor burnout. There are iPhone and Android
          chargers in the main room closet in case you forget.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="hint">
        <h3>Keys</h3>
        <p>
          Rebecca will give you all necessary keys, and explain their use and
          the security rules. No one else but she and you will have access to
          the dehumidified storage unit.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="hint">
        <h3>Money</h3>
        <p>
          U.S. dollars can be changed at any of several banks in Quepos and
          Manuel Antonio. The closest is a 15-minute walk toward the beach.
          There are ATMs there and in Quepos that take bank cards. All
          businesses and restaurants accept U.S. dollars, and almost all accept
          major credit cards.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="hint">
        <h3>Restaurants</h3>
        <p>
          There are many simple-to-high-end restaurants within easy walking
          distance of the villa, several of which offer the best dining
          experiences available in the Quepos-Manuel Antonio area. Don't
          hesitate to ask Rebecca to recommend any of them and give information
          about quality and pricing.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="hint">
        <h3>Chef</h3>
        <p>
          Carlos is our go-to chef for catering and meals prepared on premises.
          We can show you his menu of local and East Asian specialties and put
          you in direct contact with him for any arrangements.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="hint">
        <h3>Groceries</h3>
        <p>
          An eight-minute walk toward the beach brings you to a supermarket
          named Super Josette, which has everything you need: fresh meat, fish,
          vegetables, fruits, and a wide selection of juices, beer, wine, and
          liquors and an excellent juice and wine selection. Fresh-baked bread
          and pastries are available at a bakery only several minutes away.
          There's a wide range of stores in Quepos to suit every need. However,
          the freshest produce is available Friday evenings and Saturdays at the
          Farmers' Market. For simple items there is a well stocked small store
          near the entrance to the property.

          <p>
            If you care about you're morning cup as much as we do you should buy
            your roasts at one of

              >Cafe Milagro's</a

        <h3>Traveling</h3>
        <p>
          We know this area well (we've been coming here since 1980) but for
          newcomers we strongly recommend a good travel book such as Lonely
          Planet or the New Key to Costa Rica (house copies of these are
          available and should not be removed). It is a good idea to look at
          <a target="_blank" href="www.quepolandia.com">Quepolandia</a>
          (click on "visitor resources") before arriving, for current
          information about restaurants, transportation, and local events. The
          free monthly print version is available at many stores.
        </p>
        <p>
          From San Jose's international airport, Quepos is a twenty-minute
          flight away, or you may enjoy bus ride of a few hours or rent a car,
          or hire a taxi. Rebecca can assist you with local travel arrangements,
          including current taxi rates. All taxis become collectivos, charging a
          flat price per person when they return from the beach toward Quepos.
          The Quepos-Manuel Antonio bus runs every half hour, more often at busy
          times. The nearest bus stop (5 minutes away) is in front of Manuel
          Antonio's soccer field.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="hint">
        <h3>Insect tips</h3>
        <p>
          Nature is in balance here, and because of the bountiful bird life,
          insects are rarely a problem. Little ankle-nippers may visit at dusk,
          so use the floor fans and the several high-speed ceiling fans. We are
          rarely bothered by mosquitoes, but for those who react to them, we
          recommend lotions and the use of our mosquito nets at night. The
          larger bugs are totally harmless and some, like scarab beetles, are a
          marvel to watch. The fireflies are a delight.
        </p>
        <p>
          We tend not to use non-organic insect sprays, though we keep organic
          ones handy: bugs simply don't like white walls and yellow lights, they
          don't like not having hidden spaces to crawl into, and they are bored
          by people who put food away and keep the dishes clean.
        </p>
        <p>
          A well-trimmed lawn keeps bugs away from the house. The nightjars and
          the flycatchers and the swallows and the blue-grey tanagers and house
          wrens do the rest. Tiny ants, however, will sometimes mysteriously
          appear, and they do an efficient job of cleaning up - if you haven't -
          but disappear if there's no work available.

      <h3>Between San Jose and Quepos</h3>
      <p>
        Traveling in Costa Rica can be an exciting and educational part of your
        vacation experience, but it also has the potential to be challenging.
        Due to the topography of the country, the infrastructure and the
        weather, travel times can vary widely. You should fly into our
        international airport in San José (Juan Santamaria). From there you'll
        have several options to get to the Quepos/Manuel Antonio area. Your
        choice will be based upon the arrival and departure times of your
        flights in/out of San José, personal preferences, and your budget.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Fly
            <a
              href="https://flysansa.com/manuel-antonio-quepos/"
              target="_blank"
              >Sansa Air</a
            >
            between the domestic terminal adjacent to the San Jose international
            airport and Quepos. Up to 7 flights a day. Cost: under $100 USD.
            Time: 20 minutes. Planning note: none of the local airports in Costa
            Rica have runway lights or control towers, so the flights only
            operate from sunrise to sunset (about 6:30 AM until 5 PM) and less
            frequently from May thru November.
          </p>
          <p>
            Check baggage policies carefully. The weight limits are enforced,
            which means that while they will take your bags, you’ll pay for the
            extra weight. Upon arrival in San José, you’ll need at least 1½
            hours before your flight to Quepos. When returning to San José to
            connect with your international flight give yourself 2 hours to
            connect.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Take an express bus between the San Jose and Manuel Antonio bus
            terminals. Approximately 3 hours. Cost: ~$30 USD. For reasons that
            mystify us, no buses pick up at the international airport thus
            necessitating an arduous trip into the city.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Take a taxi directly from the San Jose airport. Cost: $120-160 USD
            depending on season, vehicle and your bargaining accumen. Approx.
            2.5 hours. It is a pleasant drive unless you're travelling to the
            coast at the end of the week when traffic can get a bit heavy.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Rent a car at the airport. You do not need a car in Manuel
            Antonio as bus and taxi service are more than adequate. If desired,
            you can rent a car in Manuel Antonio for day trips. 
            <em>Be sure to download and use the Waze app for use in Costa Rica - it is the best by far.</em>
          </p>
            <p>
              Notes: after a long, international flight, it can be very stressful and time consuming, picking up a rental car and finding your way to Manuel Antonio, especially at night. Renting will take at least an hour. (No express service here.) Upon returning the car, it will take 45 minutes for them to inspect it, close the contract and to get back to the airport. According to some, Adobe is the best of a bad lot and will not attempt to upsell insurance etc.
            </p>
          </p>

      </ul>

      <h3>From Quepos to Villa Tekla</h3>
      <p>
        The trip to Villa Tekla starts on the main road to Manuel Antonio
        National Park with one turn at Hotel Villas Lirio.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once you leave Quepos towards the beaches be on the alert for Villas
        Lirio on your left (about a five minute ride). Villas Lirio is preceded
        by Hotel Teva and then Captains Hotel on the left. In front of Villas
        Lirio you will find the road to Villa Tekla. Continue approx 250 meters
        up the road until Finca los Mangos - 10 meters before the small Super
        Joseth market and a fork in the road. (Do not go past the store!) Villa
        Tekla is on the left before the fork with a black metal gate with a
        VILLA TEKLA sign. The driveway leads to a white three-level house.
      </p>
      <p>
        The buses from San Jose will let you off across from the Manuel Antonio
        school. The local buses will let you off at the stops near the school's
        soccer field. The house is a 5 minute walk from the school up the Villa
        Lirio road.
