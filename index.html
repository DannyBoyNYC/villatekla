        <h2 id="about">Privacy, security &amp; nature</h2>

        <p>
          Villa Tekla is a distinctive three-bedroom, three-level
          Spanish-Moorish hacienda, an eco-friendly villa designed for the
          tropics, on five acres of forest and landscaped grounds, with ocean
          and mountain views, set off the main road. It has extensive patios, is
          fully furnished and immediately below it is a private pool. It can
          easily accommodate three couples and is suitable for families
          traveling together.
        </p>
        <p>
          Especially designed for the climate of Costa Rica's south-central
          coast, it is an open house, with a screened pool-level en suite
          bedroom. It is protected from both sun and rain by wide roof overhangs
          and is intended to provide an optimal experience for nature lovers and
          yet be entirely secure. Sitting atop a spur over jungle that runs all
          the way to Manuel Antonio National Park, it commands views west, north
          and east, towards the ocean and the forests and the mountains. Rare
          precious and semi-precious flowering hardwoods shade it from the sun.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some of the acreage is planted in various fruit species, most of it a
          natural canopied forest. The pool has tiled patios immediately
          adjacent to the house.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          Villa Tekla is our family home. We do not rent it as a profit-making
          business, but only to ensure that we will not have to lay off any of
          our loyal, longterm staff for the months we aren’t there.
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          The property is midway between the thriving tourist town of Quepos and
          the beaches of
          <a
            href="http://www.sinac.go.cr/EN-US/ac/acopac/pnma/Pages/default.aspx"
            target="_blank"
            >Manuel Antonio National Park</a
          >. The main beach is five minutes away by car or bus, thirty minutes
          by foot. Several smaller, unpopulated beaches are even closer and we
          can provide directions to them. The park, with its crescent beaches,
          trails and wildlife, offers nature lovers a unique, unforgettable
          experience. It opens at seven a.m. daily, but is closed Monday. It's
          best to visit early in the morning, when the wildlife is most active.
          Even though staying at Villa Tekla offers the opportunity to see as
          much, if not more, wildlife than a typical day in the park, it is
          still worth visiting for its wonderful walks and beaches.

          of the park.
        </p>
        <p>
          Though at nine degrees latitude, the climate is benign, the
          temperature ranging from the lows 20s to low 30s C (low 70s to low 80s
          F), depending on time and season. The dry season extends roughly from
          Christmas to Easter, but is variable, and is cooled by fresh breezes
          from the ocean during the hottest hours. The green season (there is no
          winter or summer in Costa Rica) is preferred by many, with its rain at
          night, late-afternoon sun-showers, morning mists, rainbows and verdant
          growth - and unpeopled beaches. Occasionally, the rain can fall in
          torrents, and it's an experience which many visitors enjoy. Wide roof
          overhangs and rain blinds keep the villa dry. The house has been
          carefully situated so that the sun does not enter in the heat of the
          day, and it offers brilliant sunset views in the Green Season.
        </p>
        <p>
          As you relax in one of our hammocks, don't be surprised if the titis
          (squirrel monkeys) come by the house, swinging from tree to tree and
          clambering over the roof. Cara blancas (white-face cappuchin monkeys)
          visit regularly too, and in the early morning howler monkeys can be
          heard calling from the tall trees. Other animals we have seen from the
          house include sloths, coatis, raccoons, armadillos, anteaters, pacas,
          agoutis, land and tree iguanas, a peccary that wandered down from the
          mountains, and a Mexican dwarf porcupine. Birders will be awed by the
          numbers and variety of parrots, parakeets, hummingbirds, mot-mots,
          toucans, manikins, orioles, flycatchers, swallows, tanagers,
          woodpeckers, wrens, thrushes, trogons, hawks, and you'll awake at dawn
          to a many-throated chorus. At night you'll hear nightjars, owls,
          pootoos, laughing falcons, a constant melody of crickets and frogs,
          and the singing geckoes that patrol for small bugs. Birds and
          butterflies fly in and out.
        </p>

        <p>
          And from time to time you'll hear the distant crash and rumble of the
          Pacific surf.

          Information and hints to enhance your tropical living experience
        </h2>

        <h3>House Manager</h3>
        <p>
          Rebecca Wells is our villa manager in Manuel Antonio, and her husband
          Jacob is a skilled contractor and a computer electronics consultant.
          They live only a few minutes down our road. She and Jacob are
          completely bilingual, will help you with any problems, and will assist
          you with arrival arrangements.
        </p>

        <h3>Maid and Gardener</h3>
        <p>
          Our maid comes mornings twice a week for four or five hours. If you
          would like additional help, Rebecca can arrange for that at the maid's
          regularly hourly rate, and she can be hired as well to do your
          personal laundry in the washer/drier. There is also a wash and fold
          laundromat service nearby at Hotel Flor Blanca. Our gardener comes
          once a week, early in the morning, for grounds maintenance. We hope
          you will treat our staff with trust and respect - they have ours.
        </p>

        <h3>Linens and Towels</h3>
        <p>
          We supply all essential household goods, including linens and towels,
          but please do not take our towels to the beach.
        </p>

        <h3>Communications</h3>
        <p>
          We have a smart TV with Netflix etc. available for use. Our house
          telephone line 2777-1092 does not permit international calls.
          High-speed Internet service will provide those who bring devices with
          reliable WiFi. The password is in the booklet near the phone.
        </p>

        <h3>Waste Disposal</h3>
        <p>
          Please follow basic ecologically sound practices. There's a recycling
          container in the kitchen which the gardener will sort and empty from
          time to time. The maid will dispose of garbage, but if you need to do
          so yourself, you may place bagged garbage into a neighbourhood bin
          just down the road which is emptied regularly by the municipal
          service.
        </p>

        <h3>Garden</h3>
        <p>
          Enjoy any fruit that ripens in the orchard. Bananas, papayas,
          pineapples, grapefruit, lemons, limes, sour and sweet oranges, mangos,
          coconuts, avocados and guayabana grow in front of and below the house.
          Many of these are seasonal, however, and our gardener will offer fruit
          as it comes available - or ask him to pick for you.
        </p>

        <h3>Water</h3>
        <p>
          We are connected to the municipal system, and the water as in most of
          Costa Rica is potable. Please rinse off beach sand in the outside
          shower before using those inside; otherwise the bathroom drains clog.
          We are on a septic system, so please do not flush non-biodegradables
          (dental floss, tampons, condoms etc.) which clog the septic tank.
        </p>

        <h3>Climate</h3>
        <p>
          The climate tends to make electronic equipment and kitchen appliances
          more fragile than up north, so take more care with them than you
          usually would. During the green season, keep anything sensitive and
          electronic such as computer equipment in the dehumidified built-in
          wall unit in the living room with the TV. The sliding doors should be
          kept shut and locked when the devices are not in use.
        </p>
        <p>
          A temporal - two or three successive days of rain and drizzle - occurs
          rarely, and only in the green season. Leather goods can get a coating
          of fungus and are not recommended for this climate. Keep clothing
          free-hung so it has proper air circulation. In this part of the world,
          people never leave wet clothing in a heap - that encourages mildew. If
          it pours, just remember that the sun will soon shine. It is only with
          strong winds that you need lower any of the rain blinds or shut the
          wooden blinds.
        </p>

        <h3>Power</h3>
        <p>
          We are on the same voltage system as North America, and will run your
          hair dryer and all powered devices. The refrigerator should not be
          kept open, as that risks motor burnout.
        </p>

        <h3>Keys</h3>
        <p>
          Rebecca will give you all necessary keys, and explain their use and
          the security rules. No one else but she and you will have access to
          the dehumidified storage unit.
        </p>

        <h3>Groceries</h3>
        <p>
          An eight-minute walk toward the beach brings you to a supermarket
          named Super Josette, which has everything you need: fresh meat, fish,
          vegetables, fruits, and a wide selection of juices, beer, wine, and
          liquors and an excellent juice and wine selection. Fresh-baked bread
          and pastries are available at a bakery only several minutes away.
          There's a wide range of stores in Quepos to suit every need. However,
          the freshest produce is available Friday evenings and Saturdays at the
          Farmers' Market. For simple items there is a well stocked small store
          near the entrance to the property.
        </p>

        <h3>Money</h3>
        <p>
          U.S. dollars can be changed at any of several banks in Quepos and
          Manuel Antonio. The closest is a 15-minute walk toward the beach.
          There are ATMs there and in Quepos that take bank cards. All
          businesses and restaurants accept U.S. dollars, and almost all accept
          major credit cards.
        </p>

        <h3>Restaurants</h3>
        <p>
          There are many simple-to-high-end restaurants within easy walking
          distance of the villa, several of which offer the best dining
          experiences available in the Quepos-Manuel Antonio area. Don't
          hesitate to ask Rebecca to recommend any of them and give information
          about quality and pricing.
        </p>

        <h3>Traveling</h3>
        <p>
          We know this area well (we've been coming here since 1980) but for
          newcomers we strongly recommend a good travel book such as Lonely
          Planet or the New Key to Costa Rica (house copies of these should not
          be removed). It is a good idea to look at
          <a target="_blank" href="www.quepolandia.com">quepolandia.com</a>
          (click on "visitor resources") before arriving, for current
          information about restaurants, transportation, and local events. The
          free monthly print version is available at many stores.
        </p>
        <p>
          From San Jose's international airport, Quepos is a twenty-minute
          flight away, or you may enjoy bus ride of a few hours or rent a car,
          or hire a taxi. Rebecca can assist you with local travel arrangements,
          including current taxi rates. All taxis become collectivos, charging a
          flat price per person when they return from the beach toward Quepos.
          The Quepos-Manuel Antonio bus runs every half hour, more often at busy
          times. The nearest bus stop (5 minutes away) is in front of Manuel
          Antonio's soccer field.
        </p>

        <h3>Insect tips</h3>
        <p>
          Nature is in balance here, and because of the bountiful bird life,
          insects are rarely a problem. Little ankle-nippers may visit at dusk,
          so use the floor fans and the several high-speed ceiling fans. We are
          rarely bothered by mosquitoes, but for those who react to them, we
          recommend lotions and the use of our mosquito nets at night. The
          larger bugs are totally harmless and some, like scarab beetles, are a
          marvel to watch. The fireflies are a delight.
        </p>
        <p>
          We tend not to use non-organic insect sprays, though we keep organic
          ones handy: bugs simply don't like white walls and yellow lights, they
          don't like not having hidden spaces to crawl into, and they are bored
          by people who put food away and keep the dishes clean.
        </p>
        <p>
          A well-trimmed lawn keeps bugs away from the house. The nightjars and
          the flycatchers and the swallows and the blue-grey tanagers and house
          wrens do the rest. Tiny ants, however, will sometimes mysteriously
          appear, and they do an efficient job of cleaning up - if you haven't -
          but disappear if there's no work available.
        </p>

        <h3>Finally</h3>
        <p>
          Please respect our home as you would your own. We do not rent it as a
          profit-making business, but only to ensure that we will not have to
          lay off any of our loyal, longterm staff for the months we aren’t
          there. We hope you have as pleasant a stay as we do when we are there,
          and at the end of it, if you have any comments - useful, critical or
          otherwise - please let Rebecca know. Enjoy the house and the wonders
          of nature and Tico culture that surrounds it.

              >
              between the domestic terminal adjacent to the San Jose
              international airport and Quepos. Up to 7 flights a day. Cost:
              $80-90 USD. Time: 20 minutes.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Take an express bus between the San Jose and Manuel Antonio bus
              terminals. Approximately 3 hours. Cost: ~$30 USD. For reasons that
              mystify us, no buses pick up at the international airport thus
              necessitating a trip into the city.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Take a taxi directly from the San Jose airport. Cost: $120-160 USD
              depending on season, vehicle and your bargaining accumen. Approx.
              2.5 hours. It is a pleasant drive unless you're travelling to the
              coast at the end of the week when traffic can get a bit heavy.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Rent a car at the airport. Note: you do not need a car in Manuel
              Antonio as bus and taxi service are more than adequate. If
              desired, you can rent a car in Manuel Antonio for day trips. There
              are no rental agencies at the airport so be prepared for a short
              courtesy van ride.

        <h3>From Quepos to Villa Tekla</h3>
        <p>
          The trip to Villa Tekla follows the main road to Manuel Antonio
          National Park as far as Hotel Villas Lirio, just before the Manuel
          Antonio primary school. At that point, take a sharp left and carry on
          up the El Lirio road for approximately 250 meters. Villa Tekla is on
          the left just before the store and the fork in the road. There is a
          black metal gate with a VILLA TEKLA sign. The driveway leads to a
          white three-level house.
        </p>

          The buses from San Jose will let you off across from the Manuel
          Antonio school. The local buses will let you off at the stops near the
          school's soccer field. The house is a 5 minute walk from the school up
          the Villa Lirio road.
