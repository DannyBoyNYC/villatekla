      <h2 id="about">Privacy, security, nature</h2>

      <p>
        Villa Tekla is a distinctive three-bedroom, three-level Spanish-Moorish
        hacienda, an eco-friendly villa designed for the tropics, on five acres
        of forest and landscaped grounds, with ocean and mountain views, set off
        the main road. It has extensive patios, is fully furnished and
        immediately below it is a private pool. It can easily accommodate three
        couples and is perfect for families traveling together.
      </p>
      <p>
        Villa Tekla is completely private - although you might hear an
        occasional vehicle on the road, there are no visible neighbors. It feels
        as though you are in the middle of the jungle - with the convenience of
        a store at the end of the long driveway!
      </p>
      <p>
        Especially designed for the climate of Costa Rica's south-central coast,
        Villa Tekla is an open house, with screened lower, main and upper level
        bedrooms. It is protected from both sun and rain by wide roof overhangs
        and is intended to provide an optimal experience for nature lovers and
        yet be entirely secure. Sitting atop a volcanic spur over jungle that
        runs all the way to Manuel Antonio National Park, it commands views
        west, north and east, towards the ocean and the forests and the
        mountains. Rare precious and semi-precious flowering hardwoods shade it
        from the sun.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some of the acreage is planted in various fruit species, the rest of it
        is a natural canopied forest. The pool has tiled patios immediately
        adjacent to the house.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        Villa Tekla is our family home. We do not rent it as a profit-making
        business, but only to ensure that we will not have to lay off any of our
        loyal, longterm staff for the months we aren’t there.
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        The property is midway between the thriving tourist town of Quepos and
        the beaches of
        <a
          href="http://www.sinac.go.cr/EN-US/ac/acopac/pnma/Pages/default.aspx"
          target="_blank"
          >Manuel Antonio National Park</a
        >. The main beach is five minutes away by car or bus, thirty minutes by
        foot. Several smaller, less populated beaches are even closer and we can
        provide directions to them. The park, with its crescent beaches, trails
        and wildlife, offers nature lovers a unique, unforgettable experience.
        It opens at seven a.m. daily, but is closed Monday. It's best to visit
        early in the morning, when the wildlife is most active. Even though
        staying at Villa Tekla offers the opportunity to see as much, if not
        more, wildlife than a typical day in the park, it is still worth
        visiting for its wonderful walks and beaches.

        of Manuel Antonio National park.
      </p>
      <p>
        Though at nine degrees latitude, the climate is benign, the temperature
        ranging from the lows 20s to low 30s C (low 70s to low 80s F), depending
        on time and season. The dry season extends roughly from Christmas to
        Easter, but is variable, and is cooled by fresh breezes from the ocean
        during the hottest hours. The green season (there is no winter or summer
        in Costa Rica) is preferred by many, with its rain at night,
        late-afternoon sun-showers, morning mists, rainbows and verdant growth -
        and unpeopled beaches. Occasionally, the rain can fall in torrents, and
        it's an experience which many visitors enjoy. Wide roof overhangs and
        rain blinds keep the villa dry. The house has been carefully situated so
        that the sun does not enter in the heat of the day, and it offers
        brilliant sunset views in the Green Season.
      </p>
      <p>
        As you relax in one of our hammocks, don't be surprised if the titis
        (squirrel monkeys) come by the house, swinging from tree to tree and
        clambering over the roof. Cara blancas (white-face cappuchin monkeys)
        visit regularly too, and in the early morning howler monkeys can be
        heard calling from the tall trees. Other animals we have seen from the
        house include sloths, coatis, raccoons, armadillos, anteaters, pacas,
        agoutis, land and tree iguanas, a peccary that wandered down from the
        mountains, and a Mexican dwarf porcupine. Birders will be awed by the
        numbers and variety of parrots, parakeets, hummingbirds, mot-mots,
        toucans, manikins, orioles, flycatchers, swallows, tanagers,
        woodpeckers, wrens, thrushes, trogons, hawks, and you'll awake at dawn
        to a many-throated chorus. At night you'll hear nightjars, owls,
        pootoos, laughing falcons, a constant melody of crickets and frogs, and
        the singing geckoes that patrol for small bugs. Birds and butterflies
        fly in and out.
      </p>

      <p>
        And from time to time you'll hear the distant crash and rumble of the
        Pacific surf.

        Information and hints to enhance your tropical living experience
      </h2>

      <h3>House Manager</h3>
      <p>
        Rebecca Wells is our villa manager in Manuel Antonio, and her husband
        Jacob is a skilled contractor and a computer electronics consultant.
        They live only a few minutes down our road. She and Jacob are completely
        bilingual, will help you with any problems, and will assist you with
        arrival arrangements.
      </p>

      <h3>Maid and Gardener</h3>
      <p>
        Our maid comes mornings twice a week for four or five hours. If you
        would like additional help, Rebecca can arrange for that at the maid's
        regularly hourly rate, and she can be hired as well to do your personal
        laundry in the washer/drier. There is also a wash and fold laundromat
        service nearby at Hotel Flor Blanca. Our gardener comes once a week,
        early in the morning, for grounds maintenance. We hope you will treat
        our staff with trust and respect - they have ours.
      </p>

      <h3>Linens and Towels</h3>
      <p>
        We supply all essential household goods, including linens and towels,
        but please do not take our towels to the beach.
      </p>

      <h3>Communications</h3>
      <p>
        We have a smart TV with Netflix etc. available for use. Our house
        telephone line, 2777-1092, does not permit international calls.
        High-speed Internet service will provide those who bring devices with
        reliable WiFi. Since we often work from here internet access (fiber
        optic) is faster than you'll typically find elsewhere and can be
        upgraded up to 500mbps (for an additional charge) if required. The WiFi
        password is in the booklet near the phone.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cell towers are nearby and coverage is excellent for those who choose
        roaming.
      </p>

      <h3>Waste Disposal</h3>
      <p>
        Please follow basic ecologically sound practices. There's a white
        composting container in the kitchen which the gardener will sort and
        empty from time to time. If you wish to empty it yourself the compost
        bin is behind the garden shed near the entrance. The maid will dispose
        of garbage, but if you need to do so yourself, you may place bagged
        garbage into a neighbourhood bin just down the road which is emptied
        regularly by the municipal service.
      </p>

      <img src="img/2020c/450x600/IMG_3515.jpg" alt="Gardener with bananas" />
      <h3>Garden</h3>
      <p class="clearfix">
        Enjoy any fruit that ripens in the orchard. Bananas, papayas,
        pineapples, grapefruit, lemons, limes, sour and sweet oranges, mangos,
        coconuts, avocados and guayabana grow in front of and below the house.
        Many of these are seasonal, however, and our gardener will offer fruit
        as it comes available. It can be difficult for northerners to dsicent
        ripeness and availablity so please don't hesitate to ask him to pick for
        you. He's usually here on Fridays.
      </p>

      <h3>Water</h3>
      <p>
        We are connected to the municipal system, and the water, as in most of
        Costa Rica is potable. Please rinse off beach sand in the outside shower
        before using those inside; otherwise the bathroom drains clog. We are on
        a septic system, so please do not flush non-biodegradables (dental
        floss, tampons, condoms etc.) which clog the septic tank.
      </p>

      <h3>Weather</h3>
      <p>
        The climate tends to make electronic equipment and kitchen appliances
        more fragile than up north, so take more care with them than you usually
        would. During the green season, keep anything sensitive and electronic
        such as computer equipment in the dehumidified built-in wall unit in the
        living room with the TV. The sliding doors should be kept shut and
        locked when the devices are not in use.
      </p>
      <p>
        A temporal - two or three successive days of rain and drizzle - occurs
        rarely, and only in the green season. Leather goods can get a coating of
        fungus and are not recommended for this climate. Keep clothing free-hung
        so it has proper air circulation. In this part of the world, people
        never leave wet clothing in a heap - that encourages mildew. If it
        pours, just remember that the sun will soon shine. It is only with
        strong winds that you need lower any of the rain blinds or shut the
        wooden blinds.
      </p>

      <h3>Power</h3>
      <p>
        We are on the same voltage system as North America, and will run your
        hair dryer and all powered devices. The refrigerator should not be kept
        open, as that risks motor burnout. There are iPhone and Android chargers
        in the main room closet in case you forget.
      </p>

      <h3>Keys</h3>
      <p>
        Rebecca will give you all necessary keys, and explain their use and the
        security rules. No one else but she and you will have access to the
        dehumidified storage unit.
      </p>

      <h3>Money</h3>
      <p>
        U.S. dollars can be changed at any of several banks in Quepos and Manuel
        Antonio. The closest is a 15-minute walk toward the beach. There are
        ATMs there and in Quepos that take bank cards. All businesses and
        restaurants accept U.S. dollars, and almost all accept major credit
        cards.
      </p>

      <h3>Restaurants</h3>
      <p>
        There are many simple-to-high-end restaurants within easy walking
        distance of the villa, several of which offer the best dining
        experiences available in the Quepos-Manuel Antonio area. Don't hesitate
        to ask Rebecca to recommend any of them and give information about
        quality and pricing.
      </p>

      <h3>Chef</h3>
      <p>
        Carlos is our go-to chef for catering and meals prepared on premises. We
        can show you his menu of local and East Asian specialties and put you in
        direct contact with him for any arrangements.
      </p>

      <h3>Groceries</h3>
      <p>
        An eight-minute walk toward the beach brings you to a supermarket named
        Super Josette, which has everything you need: fresh meat, fish,
        vegetables, fruits, and a wide selection of juices, beer, wine, and
        liquors and an excellent juice and wine selection. Fresh-baked bread and
        pastries are available at a bakery only several minutes away. There's a
        wide range of stores in Quepos to suit every need. However, the freshest
        produce is available Friday evenings and Saturdays at the Farmers'
        Market. For simple items there is a well stocked small store near the
        entrance to the property.
      </p>

        alt="Happy coffee shoppers"
        style="float: right"
      />
      <h3>Coffee</h3>

      <p class="clearfix">
        If you care about you're morning cup as much as we do you should buy
        your roasts at one of
        <a href="https://www.cafemilagro.com" target="_blank">Cafe Milagro's</a>
        two locations. One
        <a href="http://elpatiodecafemilagro.com/" target="_blank"
          >near the house</a
        >
        on the main road to the beaches just past
        <a href="http://barbarojarestaurante.com" target="_blank">Barba Roja</a>
        (<em>the</em> local bar, killer sunset views and great happy hour) and
        another in Quepos near the main bridge into town.
      </p>

      <h3>Traveling</h3>
      <p>
        We know this area well (we've been coming here since 1980) but for
        newcomers we strongly recommend a good travel book such as Lonely Planet
        or the New Key to Costa Rica (house copies of these are available and
        should not be removed). It is a good idea to look at
        <a target="_blank" href="www.quepolandia.com">Quepolandia</a>
        (click on "visitor resources") before arriving, for current information
        about restaurants, transportation, and local events. The free monthly
        print version is available at many stores.
      </p>
      <p>
        From San Jose's international airport, Quepos is a twenty-minute flight
        away, or you may enjoy bus ride of a few hours or rent a car, or hire a
        taxi. Rebecca can assist you with local travel arrangements, including
        current taxi rates. All taxis become collectivos, charging a flat price
        per person when they return from the beach toward Quepos. The
        Quepos-Manuel Antonio bus runs every half hour, more often at busy
        times. The nearest bus stop (5 minutes away) is in front of Manuel
        Antonio's soccer field.
      </p>

      <h3>Insect tips</h3>
      <p>
        Nature is in balance here, and because of the bountiful bird life,
        insects are rarely a problem. Little ankle-nippers may visit at dusk, so
        use the floor fans and the several high-speed ceiling fans. We are
        rarely bothered by mosquitoes, but for those who react to them, we
        recommend lotions and the use of our mosquito nets at night. The larger
        bugs are totally harmless and some, like scarab beetles, are a marvel to
        watch. The fireflies are a delight.
      </p>
      <p>
        We tend not to use non-organic insect sprays, though we keep organic
        ones handy: bugs simply don't like white walls and yellow lights, they
        don't like not having hidden spaces to crawl into, and they are bored by
        people who put food away and keep the dishes clean.
      </p>
      <p>
        A well-trimmed lawn keeps bugs away from the house. The nightjars and
        the flycatchers and the swallows and the blue-grey tanagers and house
        wrens do the rest. Tiny ants, however, will sometimes mysteriously
        appear, and they do an efficient job of cleaning up - if you haven't -
        but disappear if there's no work available.
      </p>

      <h3>Finally</h3>
      <p>
        Please respect our home as you would your own. We do not rent it as a
        profit-making business, but only to ensure that we will not have to lay
        off any of our loyal, longterm staff for the months we aren’t there. We
        hope you have as pleasant a stay as we do when we are there, and at the
        end of it, if you have any comments - useful, critical or otherwise -
        please let Rebecca know. Enjoy the house and the wonders of nature and
        Tico culture that surrounds it.

            Antonio as bus and taxi service are more than adequate. If desired,
            you can rent a car in Manuel Antonio for day trips. There are no
            rental agencies at the airport so be prepared for a short courtesy
            van ride.

      <h3>From Quepos to Villa Tekla</h3>
      <p>
        The trip to Villa Tekla starts on the main road to Manuel Antonio
        National Park with one turn at Hotel Villas Lirio.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once you leave Quepos towards the beaches be on the alert for Villas
        Lirio on your left (about a five minute ride). Villas Lirio is preceded
        by Hotel Teva and then Captains Hotel on the left. In front of Villas
        Lirio you will find the road to Villa Tekla. Continue approx 250 meters
        up the road until Finca los Mangos - 10 meters before the small Super
        Joseth market and a fork in the road. (Do not go past the store!) Villa
        Tekla is on the left before the fork with a black metal gate with a
        VILLA TEKLA sign. The driveway leads to a white three-level house.
      </p>
      <p>
        The buses from San Jose will let you off across from the Manuel Antonio
        school. The local buses will let you off at the stops near the school's
        soccer field. The house is a 5 minute walk from the school up the Villa
        Lirio road.
